This repo contains my efforts from the last two days (20141113 and 20141112) in practicing fissionjs. The app is simple enough: going to the index page presents the user with an admin panel to create users, whos only properties are first name, last name, and 'status', which is represented by an expanse of either green or red. Users that exist in the database are listed below, and can be editted and deleted. The users persist between sessions on the index page. The screenshots give a pretty complete demonstration of what goes on.
